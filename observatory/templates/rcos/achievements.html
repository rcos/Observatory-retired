    Glide (a RCOS project of <b> Rob Carr </b>) has ben written in LWN news.
    A blurb fron that <a href= http://lwn.net/Articles/386321/> LWN site</a>
    <pre>
    Good presentations, and good presenters, are not a result of good software. 
    But bad presentation software can make creating a good presentation much 
    more challenging. Rather than complaining about poor presentation-ware, 
    Robert Carr and Amy Wieliczka have been working on Glide: a Clutter/GTK-based 
    presentation application to fill the gap.

    Sponsored by the Rensselaer Center for Open Source Software, Glide is a 
    GNOME presentation program in its earliest stages. Glide is licensed 
    under the GPLv3, is written in Vala and C, and attempts to do away with 
    some of the baggage of standard presentation applications.

    Great job by the team headed by <b> Evan Patton </b>(started as Spring 09 RCOS project). This is a really crowning achievement for RCOS as it is a community and
