    Glide (a RCOS project of <b> Rob Carr </b>) has ben written in LWN news.
    A blurb fron that <a href= http://lwn.net/Articles/386321/> LWN site</a>
    <pre>
    Good presentations, and good presenters, are not a result of good software. 
    But bad presentation software can make creating a good presentation much 
    more challenging. Rather than complaining about poor presentation-ware, 
    Robert Carr and Amy Wieliczka have been working on Glide: a Clutter/GTK-based 
    presentation application to fill the gap.

    Sponsored by the Rensselaer Center for Open Source Software, Glide is a 
    GNOME presentation program in its earliest stages. Glide is licensed 
    under the GPLv3, is written in Vala and C, and attempts to do away with 
    some of the baggage of standard presentation applications.

    Devin Ross was tipped yesterday (3/15/2010) by Apple that they are going to feature Attic 
    (His music IPhone app) in the Itunes store. Lo and behold, you can see from the image above that Apple did indeed feature Devin's app in the front center of 
    the store (3/16/2010) <h3>Hats off to IPhone Guru Devin.</h3>

    <b>Mukkai Krishnamoorthy </b> was an invited discussant on the HFOSS panel discussion
    during the ACM SIGCSE conference, Milwaukee on March 10, 2010 .

    Devin ross's IPhone app is number 5  on top music apps on iTunes ahead of popular 
    apps like Ocarina and GuitarToolkit. Please take a look at the screen shot 
    of the rankings taken on 
    <img src="/site-media/rcos/images/top-charts.png" />  Rankings (3/6/2010). <br>It is worthwhile mentioning that Devin makes use of his
    Library extensively.

    has approximately 2,000 downloads on the Android Market. The open source code can be found  <a href=http://code.google.com/p/studidroid/downloads/list> here </a>. Also, Sean was just chosen as one of a group of top android developers who are to be part of the Device 
    Seeding Program which rewards the top developers with the newest Android devices. 
    They are distributing either a Droid or Nexus One for free to Sean because of his for-profit app, BatteryTime Lite. 
    The free version has roughly 100,000 downloads while the paid one roughly 1,200.

    <h2>Congratulations to  Sean and Diana </h2>..
