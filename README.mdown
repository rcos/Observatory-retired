# Observatory
_A Python based dashboard for the Rensselaer Center for Open Source Software_

## Licensing
Observatory is licensed under the
[ISC License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license), which is equivalent to
the two-clause BSD license.

## Features
Observatory is intended to track a group of open source projects across
their source code repositories and blogs. It also includes links to the
websites and wikis each project, but doesn't scan those for any updates.

Observatory can directly access repositories (for `git`, `hg`, and `svn`),
so the "branches don't work" problem has been eliminated. With this also comes
a full redesign. Individual commits are visible in detail, and each project
has its own page, which shows authors, smaller contributors, blog posts,
commits, and screenshots. Additionally, there is a "feed" view that shows all
of the most recent actions.

## Setup
Observatory is pretty easy to set up. Excluding the Apache and `mod_wsgi`
setup that you would want for a production environment (resources on which are
best found elsewhere, most of the dependencies) are packed in the
`observatory/lib` directory.

Observatory requires Python 2.6+ (not Python 3+) and is built on the Django web
framework. It also depends on the several packages and version control systems:

* Python Imaging Library (PIL)
* BeautifulSoup
* Git
* Mercurial

For OS X/Linux users, everything but Git can be installed using pip.

	pip install django mercurial BeautifulSoup pil
	sudo apt-get install git-core #Your native package manager here
	
If the above does not work for Linux users, the following can be used in place
of pip to install PIL and Mercurial:

	sudo apt-get install mercurial
	sudo aptitude install python-imaging
	
For Windows users Git, Mercurial, and PIL are best installed through downloaded
installers because there are several build issues when using python packaging. 
You will also want to install `easy_install` or `pip` to to manage your python
packages.

	http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/Download#Windows
	http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
	http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools
	
You will likely need to edit the `/c/Program Files/Git/etc/profile` file to put
both python and setuptools on your PATH for the GitBash shell.

	PATH=$PATH:/c/Python27:/c/Python27/Scripts
	
You can then boot up a new bash terminal and grab the pip, BeautifulSoup and
Django packages

	easy_install pip
	pip install BeautifulSoup django
	
## Fetching
Since it deals primarily with external data sources, Observatory uses a set of
scripts to pull data down and store it in the local database. There scripts are
located in the `observatory/dashboard/fetch` directory. There are two primary
scripts, `fetch_blogs.py` and `fetch_repositories.py`, the purpose of each
being fairly obvious. For development purposes, there is also a `fetch.py`
script (located up a directory from the others) which runs both fetch scripts.

The primary reason for splitting up the fetching process into two scripts is
that previously, the update process was somewhat unpleasant for users: either
click the update link (which didn't always work), or wait up to an hour. While
blogs update infrequently, commits (should) happen much more frequently.
Therefore, it is ideal to run the repository fetching script more often than
the blog fetching one. Both scripts tend to run fairly quickly (with the
exception of the initial import).

As threads and Python don't get along so well, fetching instead uses multiple
processes (via the `subprocess` module). The amount of processes can be
configured in the `settings.py` file. The usual rules about processes per CPU
core don't necessarily apply here, because a lot of the time (especially for
blog fetching) is spent waiting for servers to respond.

## Development
If you would like to help out with Observatory, that is probably a good thing.
You can either use the fork + pull request feature of Github, or just send in
patches (use Issues or email).

To set up a development environment is very easy. Just follow the instructions
in the "Setup" above, but skip the part about configuring a web server and
database, since you can use the Django development server and SQLite.

There are two scripts that are useful:
(Scripts need to be run from the Observatory directory.) 

* `observatory/dashboard/demo.py` loads up a demo set of projects and users.
* `observatory/dashboard/fetch.py` runs the repository and blog fetch scripts.

(Optional) If you don't want the demo set, you need to use syncdb manually:

* `observatory/manage.py syncdb`  creates the necessary database tables.

Once these have been run, the database will be populated with the most
recent commits and blog posts for the demo projects. Then, you can just run the
server with `./manage.py runserver` in the `observatory` directory, and access
it (typically) at `http://localhost:8000/projects`.

If you want to provide external access to the server, this can be done by
running the server with `./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:[port number]` where
[port number] is any open port you want to bind to observatory.

If you're looking for something to work on, check out the Issues page or ask
me, via email or on `#rcos` on `irc.freenode.net`.

## Page Descriptions
Projects

The front page of Observatory, gives a quick list of all projects listed in 
Observatory with links to each project page, blog, and repository. A status 
icon is next to each project title in the form of a emoticon used to denote how
recently the project has been updated. At the top of the page, a graph breaks 
down the overall status of all projects by displaying how many projects, 
repositories, and blogs have been updated within the past week.

Feed

An aggregate feed of all blog posts and commits to any project listed in 
Observatory. Contains the information of the commit or an excerpt of the blog 
post as well as who published it to which project.

Posts

An aggregate feed of all full blog posts for the projects in Observatory.

People

A listing of all developers logged in the Obseratory system. Clicking on a 
name will bring you to the user's page.

User Page

Contains contact email of the developer and a list of all projects started by 
them under the project heading. Listed under Contributed to is all the 
projects they committed changes to the project's repo. Only projects currently 
in the Observatory system will be listed here.

Project Page

Provides a listing of all authors and contributors to the project. Only users 
listed within the Observatory system will be added, not anyone who commits to 
the repo. At the bottom there are also small feeds for commits and blog posts.
